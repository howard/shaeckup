shaeckup - the minimalist's encrypted backup
============================================

shaeckup (SHell-AEs-baCKUP) is a tool to generate a custom backup script, which compresses selected files and folders into an archive, encrypts it using aespipe, and sends the whole thing to a remote server via SSH.

This backup strategy is intended for situation where you need to store sensitive data _on a less trusted computer_. For everything else, there's incremental backups - as opposed to shaeckup, which transmits all data whenever a backup is created, incremental backups only care about changes.

_Note:_ The setup doesn't install the cron job yet, you have to set it up manually at this time.
